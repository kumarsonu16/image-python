# Image API

This is a Flask-based RESTful API for handling image data stored in a database.

## Getting Started

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x on your system if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required Python packages by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Prepare your image data CSV file and update the `image_data.csv` file accordingly.
5. Run the Flask application using the following command:

`python app.py`

6. The API will start running locally. You can access it at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Endpoints

### GET /image_frames

This endpoint retrieves image frames based on the specified depth range.

#### Parameters

- `depth_min`: Minimum depth value (integer).
- `depth_max`: Maximum depth value (integer).

### Example

To retrieve image frames with depth values between 10 and 20:

`GET http://localhost:5000/image_frames?depth_min=10&depth_max=20`



## Docker Support

You can also containerize the application using Docker. To build the Docker image, run:

`docker build -t image-api .`


To run the Docker container, use:

`docker run -p 5000:5000 image-api`
